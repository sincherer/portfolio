  "title": "Designing Within Constraints: How UI/UX Designers Work with Engineering Limitations",
  "date": "Feb 16, 2024",
  "excerpt": "Whether it’s due to legacy systems, third-party dependencies, tight deadlines, or resource constraints, UI/UX designers must collaborate with engineers to balance feasibility and usability",
 "content": "<p>By SinCher, Senior UI/UX Designer</p><br/><p>In an ideal world, designers dream up innovative features, and engineers bring them to life seamlessly. But in reality, technical limitations often dictate what’s possible. Whether it’s due to legacy systems, third-party dependencies, tight deadlines, or resource constraints, UI/UX designers must collaborate with engineers to balance feasibility and usability.</p><br/><p>So, what happens when an engineer says, “That’s too complex,” or “We can’t build it that way”? Do we push harder or compromise on the user experience? The key is to collaborate, not compromise.</p><br/><h2>1️⃣ Understand the Technical Constraints Early</h2><p>💡 Why?<br/>Designers often work ahead of developers, creating high-fidelity prototypes without knowing what’s feasible. The best way to avoid rework is to involve engineers early in the design process.</p><br/><p>👨‍💻 How I handle it:</p><br/><p>During the ideation phase, I schedule a quick technical check-in with engineers to validate ideas.<br/>I ask “What are the limitations?” instead of assuming everything is possible.<br/>If something is too complex, I ask “What’s the closest alternative?”</p><br/><p>🚀 Example:<br/>While designing a custom drag-and-drop dashboard, our engineers flagged that real-time data updates would slow performance. Instead of insisting on a real-time solution, we explored an “Apply Changes” button that refreshed the dashboard in batches. Same user experience, but more efficient engineering.</p><br/><h2>2️⃣ Prioritize the Core Experience Over Perfection</h2><p>💡 Why?<br/>Sometimes, a feature isn’t impossible—it’s just not practical within the project’s constraints. Instead of forcing a pixel-perfect solution, I focus on what truly impacts the user.</p><br/><p>🎯 How I approach it:</p><br/><p>Break down the user’s needs—what’s essential vs. nice-to-have?<br/>Define a phased approach—can we launch an MVP first and enhance later?<br/>Find alternative design solutions that achieve a similar outcome.</p><br/><p>🚀 Example:<br/>We wanted to add auto-saving to a job application form, but engineering limitations made real-time saves too complex. Instead, we implemented a \"Save Draft\" button with periodic auto-save triggers. This met the user’s need without overloading the system.</p><br/><h2>3️⃣ Speak the Developer’s Language</h2><p>💡 Why?<br/>The best way to collaborate is to understand how engineers think. Instead of just handing off designs, I discuss feasibility in a way that aligns with their workflow.</p><br/><p>🔧 How I communicate with engineers:<br/>✔ Instead of saying: “This animation looks nice.”<br/>✅ I say: “Can we use CSS transitions instead of a custom animation?”</p><br/><p>✔ Instead of saying: “We need a custom filter.”<br/>✅ I say: “Can we leverage existing filtering logic from another page?”</p><br/><p>🚀 Example:<br/>For a fintech dashboard, I wanted a gradient background with dynamic data visualization, but the engineering team flagged performance concerns. Instead of pushing back, I asked:</p><br/><p>“What’s the heaviest part of this feature?”<br/>“Would using SVGs instead of Canvas improve performance?”</p><br/><p>By tweaking the approach, we found a middle ground that looked good and performed well.</p><br/><h2>4️⃣ Offer Multiple Design Solutions</h2><p>💡 Why?<br/>Engineers love problem-solving. Instead of presenting one rigid design, I provide two or three alternative approaches so we can choose the best trade-off between usability and feasibility.</p><br/><p>🛠 How I present alternatives:<br/>🔹 Option A (Ideal Solution) – The best experience but might require more effort.<br/>🔹 Option B (Balanced Solution) – Slight trade-offs, but still maintains usability.<br/>🔹 Option C (Quick Fix) – A simpler version that can be implemented fast.</p><br/><p>🚀 Example:<br/>For an editable tag system in a job listing, engineers said inline editing was too complex due to how data was stored. I proposed:<br/>1️⃣ Inline Editing (Ideal, but challenging)<br/>2️⃣ Pop-up Editing (Compromise, still intuitive)<br/>3️⃣ Static List with an \"Edit\" button (Fastest to implement)</p><br/><p>They chose Option 2, which kept the user experience smooth without adding unnecessary complexity.</p><br/><h2>5️⃣ Build a Culture of Collaboration, Not Conflict</h2><p>💡 Why?<br/>Designers and engineers are not on opposing teams—we both want to ship great products. When we hit a roadblock, I don’t take it as “engineering is limiting my creativity”—I see it as an opportunity to problem-solve together.</p><br/><p>🤝 How I foster collaboration:</p><br/><p>I invite engineers to design critiques to give early feedback.<br/>I sit with developers during implementation to fine-tune details.<br/>I celebrate wins together—when a difficult feature ships, I acknowledge their effort.</p><br/><p>🚀 Example:<br/>At GokuDos, our developers initially resisted a new design system because they thought it would slow them down. Instead of forcing it, I worked side-by-side with them to create a scalable system that made their coding easier. Over time, they became the biggest advocates for design consistency.</p><br/><h2>Final Thoughts: Design With, Not Against, Constraints</h2><p>Technical limitations are not obstacles—they are design challenges waiting to be solved. As a UI/UX designer, my role is not just to create beautiful interfaces but to work with engineers to make the best possible experience within the given constraints.</p><br/><p>Next time you hear “That’s not possible”, don’t see it as a roadblock. Instead, ask:<br/>🔹 “What’s the constraint?”<br/>🔹 “What are our alternative solutions?”<br/>🔹 “How can we balance feasibility and user experience?”</p><br/><p>Because at the end of the day, great UX is not about pushing impossible designs—it’s about crafting smart, adaptable solutions that work in the real world.</p>"

  "title": "When the PM's Logic Doesn't Add Up: How to Work with Limitations and Still Meet Business Objectives",
  "date": "Jan 30, 2024",
  "excerpt": "Sometimes, the logic behind a product decision feels off, yet as designers, we must find a way to work within limitations while still delivering a great experience and ensuring the product meets its objectives.",
 "content": "<p>By SinCher, Senior UI/UX Designer</p><br/><p>As a UI/UX designer, I often find myself in discussions where the product manager (PM) has a vision that doesn’t quite align with user needs, technical feasibility, or even business goals. Sometimes, the logic behind a product decision feels off, yet as designers, we must find a way to work within limitations while still delivering a great experience and ensuring the product meets its objectives.</p><br/><p>So, what do we do when a PM insists on a feature that doesn’t make sense? Do we push back? Do we compromise? Or do we find a smarter way to work around the limitation?</p><br/><h2>1️⃣ Identify the Root Cause of the Misalignment</h2><p>💡 Why?<br/>Sometimes, when a PM’s logic seems flawed, it’s not because they lack understanding—it’s because they are looking at the problem from a different angle (business goals, stakeholder pressure, or short-term KPIs).</p><br/><p>🔍 How I uncover the real issue:</p><br/><p>I ask “What is the business reason behind this decision?”<br/>I check if the PM is focusing on short-term goals at the cost of long-term usability.<br/>I analyze if the PM is reacting to stakeholder pressure rather than user needs.</p><br/><p>🚀 Example:<br/>A PM once insisted on adding a long, mandatory onboarding process because they believed it would reduce support tickets. I challenged the assumption by asking:</p><br/><p>“What specific issues are causing users to contact support?”<br/>“Can we solve this in a lighter way without forcing every user through a long setup?”</p><br/><p>By shifting the conversation from “Do this because I said so” to “Let’s validate this assumption”, we found a better alternative—tooltips and contextual help instead of a forced onboarding.</p><br/><h2>2️⃣ Speak in Business Terms, Not Just UX Terms</h2><p>💡 Why?<br/>PMs are often driven by business goals, KPIs, and revenue impact. If I push back using only usability arguments, they might not listen. But if I frame my feedback in terms of business impact, they are more likely to reconsider.</p><br/><p>📈 How I reframe my arguments:<br/>✔ Instead of saying: “This hurts user experience.”<br/>✅ I say: “This might increase churn and lower retention.”</p><br/><p>✔ Instead of saying: “This layout is confusing.”<br/>✅ I say: “Users may drop off before completing the purchase.”</p><br/><p>🚀 Example:<br/>A PM wanted to hide the “Skip” button on a sign-up page to force users into completing their profile. Instead of saying “That’s bad UX”, I said:</p><br/><p>“Our data shows that forcing users into something increases drop-off rates.”<br/>“A more subtle approach, like encouraging completion later, could improve retention.”</p><br/><p>By aligning UX concerns with business objectives, I got buy-in without direct resistance.</p><br/><h2>3️⃣ Offer Alternative Solutions That Balance Business & UX</h2><p>💡 Why?<br/>PMs often push for features based on business needs (e.g., monetization, engagement, stakeholder requests). Instead of rejecting their ideas outright, I propose better alternatives that still achieve their goals.</p><br/><p>🔄 How I present alternatives:</p><br/><p>I don’t say “This won’t work.” I say “Here’s another way to achieve the same result.”<br/>I offer low-effort, high-impact solutions that engineers can build quickly.<br/>I prioritize small wins that improve UX without sacrificing business goals.</p><br/><p>🚀 Example:<br/>A PM wanted to add a paywall too early in a freemium product, which I knew would hurt user engagement. Instead of rejecting it outright, I suggested:<br/>1️⃣ Allow limited free access first → build trust before asking for payment.<br/>2️⃣ Introduce premium features gradually → instead of blocking users immediately.<br/>3️⃣ Test a soft paywall with A/B testing → to see how users respond.</p><br/><p>This way, we didn’t abandon monetization, but we made it more user-friendly and data-driven.</p><br/><h2>4️⃣ Leverage Data to Challenge Weak Assumptions</h2><p>💡 Why?<br/>PMs love data. If I argue against a feature based only on intuition or design principles, I might lose the argument. But if I bring in real numbers, I have a stronger case.</p><br/><p>📊 How I use data to support UX decisions:</p><br/><p>I look at drop-off rates, session times, conversion rates.<br/>I check heatmaps and user recordings to see friction points.<br/>I use A/B testing to prove which approach works better.</p><br/><p>🚀 Example:<br/>A PM wanted to add more mandatory form fields to collect user data. I knew this would increase drop-offs, so I checked Google Analytics and session recordings. The data showed:</p><br/><p>Users were abandoning forms when asked for too much information upfront.<br/>A previous test showed a 20% higher completion rate with fewer fields.</p><br/><p>With this data, I convinced the PM to reduce friction while still collecting essential information.</p><br/><h2>5️⃣ Build a Collaborative Relationship with the PM</h2><p>💡 Why?<br/>It’s easy to see PMs as roadblocks, but they are actually key partners in delivering great products. Instead of fighting them, I work with them to create better outcomes.</p><br/><p>🤝 How I build a strong relationship:</p><br/><p>I listen to their concerns before pushing back.<br/>I involve them early in user research so they see real pain points.<br/>I frame our collaboration as a shared goal—not a battle between UX and business.</p><br/><p>🚀 Example:<br/>At one company, a PM and I had constant disagreements over features. Instead of arguing, I invited them to sit in on usability tests. When they saw users struggling firsthand, they became a UX advocate instead of an opponent.</p><br/><h2>Final Thoughts: Turning Limitations into Opportunities</h2><p>When a PM’s logic doesn’t seem right, it’s tempting to push back aggressively—but that rarely works. Instead, I’ve found success in:<br/>✅ Understanding their real objectives (business goals, KPIs, stakeholder pressure).<br/>✅ Speaking their language (tying UX decisions to revenue, retention, engagement).<br/>✅ Proposing alternative solutions (balancing feasibility, business, and user needs).<br/>✅ Using data to validate my perspective (showing real numbers, not just opinions).<br/>✅ Building a collaborative relationship (working together, not against each other).</p><br/><p>At the end of the day, the best products are built when UX and business goals align. As designers, our job isn’t just to make things look good—it’s to find smart ways to work within constraints and still create great experiences.</p>"
